# STAT3701-HW3

Homework 3 for STAT 3701. 3/7/2018. 

R Package titled 'MercurioRyanTools'

Note: I did not include ALL functions from homeworks and quizzes, because a few functions had the same objective as others.
I did not include these redundant functions.

The functions named plottr, filtr, and mylogl were submitted already for Quiz 3. I may have made small changes to them here.
